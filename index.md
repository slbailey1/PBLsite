## Title

Here is a brief description of the project. What we will do, what questions we will ask, etc etc. As of writing this I am not entirely sure what I am supposed to be answering because I am writing this without the handy little spreadsheet for all the questions. I cannot come up with any questions on my own, I am but a lowly script kiddie.

### What is a GMO?

A GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is an organism that was modified through technology and engineering. They do this by changing the organism's original DNA. Most GMOs (and the ones at the forefront of the GMO debate) are created from plants.

### How are GMOs made?

GMOs are made in 4 steps, remembered as DRIP:

* Determine : Scientists determine which gene should be put in the organism.
* Replicate : Scientists replicate the aformentioned gene.
* Infix : The scientists infix (put in) the gene into the DNA of th eplant.
* Pullulate : The scientists pullulate (grow) the plant and test it in both small and large fields before selling the new organism to farmers.

### Should the public use and consume GMOs?

This will explain why the public should use and comsume GMOs.
